# Udacity Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to build an asynchronous web app that dynamically updates the UI using the Web API and user data.

## Dependencies Installation
initialization - npm init;
Express - npm install express;
body-parser - npm install body-parser;
cors - npm install cors;

## Instructions
This will require modifying the server.js file and the website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use style.css to style your application to customized perfection.

## Development
If you want to continue coding you need to have nodejs and npm locally installed. You can check that by running node -v && npm -v in the terminal, which should shpw you the two versions.

Once nodejs and npm installed you simple run npm start which runs a express server locally and serves the static files. In addition, it enables two endpoints. One is a get for projectdata and the second for post projectdata.

In website/app.js I created several functions for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherAPI, saving the data through the post request and updating the UI dynamically.
